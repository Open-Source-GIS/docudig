<h1>Afghan War Diaries Explorer</h1>
<div class='main'>
<p><b><a href='/'>diarydig.org</a></b> is an independently produced website
which provides an easy way to search through the 
<a href='http://wikileaks.org/wiki/Afghan_War_Diary,_2004-2010'>Afghan War Diaries</a>, 
which were made public by <a href='http://wikileaks.org/'>Wikileaks</a> 
on 25th July 2010.  The documents are set of over 76,000 reports (with more
coming in the future) which cover the war in Afghanistan from 2004 to 2009.
</p>
<p>From the <a href='{% url afg.search %}'>search page</a>, you can browse
through all of the documents that have been released, organized by type,
category, date, number of casualties, and many other properties.  From any <a
    href='{% url afg.show_entry 1026228 %}'>document page</a>, clicking on the
<span class='links numlinks9' style='cursor: auto'>green underlined</span> text
will open a popup that links to other documents that contain those phrases,
making it possible to see important search terms and connections that you might
not otherwise notice.</p>
<p>Our hope is that this tool will be helpful to reporters and researchers who
are interested in learning more about the US's war in Afghanistan and making
sense of this important database.  If you wish to support this work, we
encourage you to make a <a
    href='http://wikileaks.org/wiki/WikiLeaks:Donate'>donation to wikileaks</a>
